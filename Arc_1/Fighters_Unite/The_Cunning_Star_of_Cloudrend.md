# The Cunning Star of Cloudrend

"Listen up, good folk, and lean in close! ’Twas in the twisting alleys of Cloudrend’s slums that this poor bard—yours truly—found herself in a rather… compromising position. A gang of thugs thought to have a laugh at my expense. Foolish, wasn’t it?"

"But then—like moonlight catching a jewel—she appeared! Radiant and clever, with eyes that sparkled like mischief itself. No sword in hand, mind you! Just magical tools, blinking and buzzing, and in moments, those ruffians were tumbling over each other, trapped in their own confusion."

"And me? I was safe, not a hair harmed! I tried to thank her—oh, I did!—but she vanished as quickly as she came, leaving only a shimmer of magic and a smile that promised the city had yet to see the last of her."
