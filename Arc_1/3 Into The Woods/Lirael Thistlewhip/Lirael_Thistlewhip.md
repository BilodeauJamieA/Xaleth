## Description

A tiny, unsettling presence, her iridescent wings shimmering like fractured glass. Teal eyes gleam with cunning behind streaks of soot, and her wild pink-blonde hair sparks with static from arcane energy. Her patchwork harness of brass, leather, and glowing crystals pulses with hidden energy, and every flick of her gauntlet hints at unpredictable, even dangerous, power lurking beneath her bright, chaotic exterior.
