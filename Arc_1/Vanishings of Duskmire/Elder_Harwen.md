# Elder Harwen

**Title**: Town Official / Clerk of Duskmire

**Race**: Human

**Age**: 67

## Description

A lean, wiry human with a slightly stooped posture. His graying hair is neatly tied back, framing sharp, attentive eyes that miss little in the town’s affairs. 

He wears simple, earth-toned robes layered with a well-worn cloak, giving him a practical yet respectable presence suited to his role as Duskmire’s town official.
