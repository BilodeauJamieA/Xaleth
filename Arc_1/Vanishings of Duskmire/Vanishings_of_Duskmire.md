# Vanishings of Duskmire

## Investigating the Catacombs

Met [Marrek](Marrek_Drosven.md) (didn't get a room)

<!-- Mules and Wagon forgotten -->

First cave investigated ended in a pile of impassable rubble

Second cave was damp and dark, eventually leading to an open cave

## Underground Connector

The cave contained a few bodies of water and various pools of oily globs

Attacked by [Grey Oozes](Gray_Ooze.png), some coming from the floor, others the stalagtites above

Party easily dispatches with oozes but takes minor burns doing so

Beau found a burnt page that emit magical aura

## Underground Bandit Camp

Beau and Giri go right to find a pair of elves huddled, sobbing in a cage

Grondar rang the bell to begin the match

Party dispatched the bandits.  Xander claims a head, while Grondar requires answers

Beau digs deep and recognizes the Verdant Veil symbol on a [handwritten letter](Handwritten_Letter.md) that Grondar found and Xander says he knows something...

## Reunited Elves

Lyria and Tibbin Bramblefoot rescued and brought back to their son

[Elder Harwen](Elder_Harwen.md) assists locking up Bandit Leader and introduces Serelis

[Serelis](Serelis_Varn.md) fanboy's the party while assisting with accomadations and promise of rewards

Grondar tests his interigation skills and finds out about the bandits working for Malgrum

Party finally gets a room at the inn ([The Ground](../../Knowledge/Magocracy/Duskmire/The_Ground.md)) and Giri puts a hole in the wall

Giri makes a revelation of a [dream](<https://bilodeaujamiea.github.io/Xaleth/Arc_1/Fighters%20Unite/Giri_Dream.md>) he had on the way to Duskmire
