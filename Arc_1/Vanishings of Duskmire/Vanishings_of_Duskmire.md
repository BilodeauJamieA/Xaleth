# Vanishings of Duskmire

## Investigating the Catacombs

Met Marrek (didn't get a room)

<!-- Mules and Wagon forgotten -->

First cave investigated ended in a pile of impassable rubble

Second cave was damp and dark, eventually leading to an open cave

## Underground Connector

The cave contained a few bodies of water and various pools of oily globs

Attacked by [Grey Oozes](Gray_Ooze.png), some coming from the floor, others the stalagtites above

Party easily dispatches with oozes but takes minor burns doing so

Beau found a burnt page that emit magical aura

## Underground Bandit Camp

Beau and Giri go right to find a pair of elves huddled, sobbing in a cage

Grondar rang the bell to begin the match

Combat has begun as bandits begin to appear, how will it unfold...
