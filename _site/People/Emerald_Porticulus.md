# Description

Tall, lean, and silver-furred, with jade-glowing eyes and emerald-trimmed robes, he commands mastery over transplanar manipulation, shifting objects and beings across dimensions. 

A sharp-minded, pragmatic man whose calm, efficient decisions are laced with sly mischief; clever, unpredictable in style, and always several steps ahead of friend and foe alike.

Has a deal with the Magocracy to regularly bring them items he is able to gather with his Transplanar Manipulation in exchange for keeping his Rank while living outside the Magocracy
