# Hallowhide Herd

The Hallowhide herd is a devout community within Divinity, composed largely of monks, clerics, paladins, and other servants of faith. United by discipline and devotion, they wander the kingdom offering wisdom, spiritual guidance, and martial training rooted in sacred philosophy. Their way of life blends prayer, meditation, and combat practice, teaching others how to balance body, spirit, and devotion. In Divinity, they are both respected mentors and humble pilgrims, sustaining themselves by sharing their teachings with all who seek enlightenment.

# Master Calveth the Stillhand
Race: Loxodon
Class: Monk (Way of Tranquility)
Age: Elderly (well beyond a century)

Appearance: Wrinkled gray hide, adorned with simple prayer beads and worn robes. His tusks are smooth with age, etched faintly with devotional carvings.

Legacy: Remembered for his legendary three-year vow of silence and immobility, a feat still spoken of among the faithful.

A monk renowned for his mastery of silence and patience, Master Calveth is said to have once meditated for three years without speaking, moving, or opening his eyes. His discipline earned him the title “Stillhand,” for he can deflect even the swiftest strike with a calm, unshaken touch. Calveth now serves as a mentor within the herd, teaching initiates that strength is not born of force but of stillness.

# Sister Merial 'Dawnveil'
Race: Loxodon
Class: Cleric (Domain of Light)
Age: 38

Appearance: Strong but youthful features; her tusks are decorated with soft ribbons of cloth given as tokens by those she has healed. Her silver robes glimmer faintly at sunrise.

Legacy: Rising voice within the Herd, seen by many as the next generation of spiritual leadership.

A cleric of radiant devotion, Sister Merial is celebrated for her work as both healer and philosopher. She is known to weave her sermons into song, carrying her voice through the forests and settlements of Divinity. Many credit her with bringing entire villages into the faith through her compassion and tireless service. Her title “Dawnveil” refers to her habit of cloaking herself in pale silver robes, said to gleam like the first light of morning.
