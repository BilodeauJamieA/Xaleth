# Thalirien

**Rank & Reputation**: The Thalirien are a minor noble Elven family within the Magocracy, holding modest influence but known for their sharp minds and ambitious nature. They operate a specialty merchant business, trading in arcane components and rare enchanted reagents—goods essential to spellcasters and magical artisans throughout the city.

**Alliance with the Verdant Veil**: Seeking greater power and status, the Thalirien secretly allied with a fey syndicate to locate Emerald Porticulus and his family. The syndicate’s planar knowledge and network of spies allowed the Thalirien to extend their reach beyond the city’s borders, tracking transplanar signatures and magical movements.
