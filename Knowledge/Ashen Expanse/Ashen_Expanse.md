# Ashen Expanse

The Ashen Expanse is a harsh and desolate land, a barren wasteland engulfed in a strange, lingering miasma whose origin is still unknown. Rather than poisoning the body, the miasma twists and disrupts the flow of magic, causing spells to fail, backfire, or take on unpredictable forms. This distortion makes the continent especially dangerous for casters, though even non-mages suffer from the chaos it brings to the land itself. Scattered across the wastes are small, isolated settlements where survival is a daily struggle, their people hardened by scarcity and constant threat. The wilds crawl with warped, unforgiving creatures, many believed to be shaped—or corrupted—by the miasma’s influence. To most of the world, the Demon Continent is a cursed and forsaken place, whispered of in dread as a land where magic itself betrays those who dare to wield it.
