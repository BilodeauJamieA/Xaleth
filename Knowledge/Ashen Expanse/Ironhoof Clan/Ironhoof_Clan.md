# Ironhoof Clan

**Credo**: “Strength is truth. Honor is life.”

The Ironhoof Clan is a proud and unyielding Rhinari tribe that thrives amidst the harsh desolation of the Ashen Expanse. To survive there is to be forged by hardship, and the Ironhoof take pride in that. Strength, endurance, and honor in combat are the pillars of their way of life, and they view any reliance on magic as weakness or corruption of the spirit.

## Culture and Beliefs

The Ironhoof believe true power comes from struggle, not magic. They honor the Beast Lords, primal gods of strength and ferocity, measuring a Rhinari’s worth by scars, victories, and devotion. Cowardice, deceit, or reliance on others is unforgivable in their eyes.

## The Riders

At the heart of the clan’s military might are The Riders, elite warriors who thunder into battle atop massive war boars bred for strength, speed, and savagery. Their unity with their mounts is a symbol of discipline and dominance, and few forces in the Expanse can withstand their charge. The Riders serve as the clan’s protectors, champions, and enforcers of tradition. Currently led by Malgrum, one of the most formidable Riders to ever live.

## Boarwardens:

Devoted breeders who cultivate war boars to peak perfection for the Riders. Their work relies on skill and dedication rather than sheer strength, and is honored as sacred labor in the name of the Beast Lords. For this reason, they are among the few in the clan respected rather than mocked for lacking raw power.

## Leadership:

A single Chieftain whose authority comes not from brute strength, but from the favor of the Beast Lords. Chosen by the spirits themselves, the Chieftain embodies the will and guidance of these primal deities, serving as the clan’s spiritual and strategic leader. Though not the strongest warrior, their wisdom, devotion, and connection to the Beast Lords command respect.
