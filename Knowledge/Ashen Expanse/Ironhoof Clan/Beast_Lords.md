# Beast Lords

A collection of primal, animal-based spirits revered by many tribes in the Ashen Expanse. They are not distant gods but living embodiments of the qualities the various clans value in the harsh living conditions of the Ashen Expanse. Two particular Beast Lords stand above the rest but their are many beyond that that represent different aspects of the natural and spiritual world.

## Tharkun

**Title**: Supreme Beast Lord

**Tenet**: “Strength tempered by honor rules all.”

**Symbol**: A towering rhino horn etched in stone

### Description: 

The colossal rhinoceros spirit embodies the ideals of the clan: raw strength, unyielding perseverance, and sacred honor. The Ironhoof believe they are descended from Tharkun himself, and that their innate power and resilience flow from his primal essence. All warriors trace their might and courage back to him, and his judgment guides the clan in matters of strength and honor.

## Korash

**Tenet**: “Together, we are unbroken.”

**Symbol**: A coiled boar tusk

### Description:

A mighty boar spirit, Korash is always at Tharkun’s side, representing loyalty, endurance, and the sacred bond between Rider and war boar. His presence explains why the Riders’ connection with their mounts is so intimate and revered—the strength of the Rider and boar together is a reflection of Korash’s spirit.

## Secondary Beast Lords

Spirits recognized within individual houses for their specialized domains. Some referencing craft, war, or hunt as examples. While they may not be worshiped by the entire clan, their favor is crucial for the prosperity and renown of their house. Some Ironhoof may even carry personal talismans or marks to honor their house’s spirit, reinforcing their dedication to both the family and the clan.
