# Religion & Gods

The heart of faith in the kingdom of Divinity centers on the worship of She-Who-Is, the almighty source of the cosmos. Around her stands the core pantheon—Ares, Artemis, Bahamut, and Tiamat—whose influence shapes much of the kingdom’s spiritual life. While countless other gods and divine beings are honored through smaller sects and private devotion, these four stand as the most prominent, drawing vast followings even among those who also pledge themselves to a personal patron deity.

The Magocrocy doesn't specifically follow any religion or beliefs strictly as they 'worship' power over all else.

## She-Who-Is

"Before all, there was She-Who-Is, the True Goddess. From the silence before time she stirred, and with her breath the stars awoke. The rivers of fate flow from her hand, and the beating of every heart echoes her eternal pulse. The lesser gods are but her dreams made flesh, sparks struck from her endless flame—some born radiant, others kindled by mortal struggle and ascension. Yet none may match her, for she alone is the font of being. To seek her is to seek the origin of all things, though none but she knows the final end."

## The Pantheon (Symbol)

**Ares** – God of Liberation (Spear)

Ares embodies the breaking of chains and the will to rise against oppression. His spear is the symbol of rebellion and freedom, striking down tyrants and opening the path to self-determination.

**Artemis** – God of Survival (Bow and Arrow)

Artemis is the eternal huntress, guiding mortals through hardship and wilderness alike. Her bow and arrow represent the struggle to endure and the wisdom to live in harmony with the wild.

**Bahamut** – God of Justice (Dragon’s Head)

Bahamut is the noble dragon-god of truth and law, his visage a shining dragon’s head. He stands for fairness, honor, and protection, ensuring that justice prevails even in the darkest of times.

**Tiamat** – God of Elements (Five-Headed Dragon)

Tiamat embodies the raw, untamed power of the elements, her five heads breathing fire, ice, lightning, acid, and poison. She is revered and feared as both a giver of primal strength and a force of devastation.
