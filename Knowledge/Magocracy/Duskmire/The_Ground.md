# The Ground

*Inn The Ground*

The only inn in Ravenâ€™s Hollow, named for its unusual construction. Its common room sits at street level, but the guest chambers are renovated sections of an old underground catacomb system beneath the town. The cool, stone-hewn rooms offer quiet and privacy, making the inn popular with travelers, merchants, and adventurers alike.
