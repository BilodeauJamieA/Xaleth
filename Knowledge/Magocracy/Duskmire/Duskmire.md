Located Northwest of Cloudrend it is in an area of rolling hills and lightly forested.

The village of Duskmire rests above a vast network of ancient catacombs. Long ago carved for forgotten purposes, the tunnels have since been repurposed by the townsfolk as storerooms, cellars, and shelters. In times of harsh winters or raider threats, families retreat below, where the stone halls provide both protection and warmth.

What was once eerie has become practical—wine racks line old crypts, grain is stored in sealed chambers, and livestock are herded underground during storms. Children grow up playing in the first few levels, though they’re warned never to wander too far.

Most of the deeper passages were bricked up generations ago, their true extent forgotten. With no strange happenings since, the villagers carry little fear of what lies beyond. For them, the catacombs are less a place of mystery than a foundation of safety and survival.
