# Parox Orthian â€“ The Construct Sovereign

**Item Type**: Legendary Artifact

## Appearance

The Parox Orthian appears as a small crystalline obelisk and a dark onyx at its core with veins of pulsating emerald light running through it. Arcane runes shift continuously across its surface, projecting a faint hum that resonates through the air. Its tip is crowned with a rotating crystal prism that refracts light into spectral patterns, giving the impression of living circuitry.

## Location:

The Parox Orthian is kept on the topmost layer of Cloudrend, in the Hall of Command,a reinforced arcane citadel where the Council of Seven resides. Access is strictly limited and only the Council may directly interface with the artifact. Each councilor has a unique rune-key to authorize access and manipulation of commands.
