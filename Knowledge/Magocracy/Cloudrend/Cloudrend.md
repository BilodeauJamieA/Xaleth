# Cloudrend

A breathtaking city of vertical tiers, each a floating disk of earth and rock hovering mysteriously above the landscape. This is the only City within the Magocracy borders, smaller towns and settlements exist but pale in comparison.

**Ground Layer**: A bustling hub of markets, guilds, and common residences. Rising above are three floating layers, each smaller than the one below, giving the city a tapered, spire-like silhouette.

**First Layer**: The largest airborne disk, home to administrative buildings, academies, artisan districts, and open plazas.

**Second Layer**: More compact and prestigious, hosting noble residences, magical laboratories, and high-ranking offices.

**Third Layer**: The smallest and highest tier, reserved for ruling officials, the elite, and sacred temples.
