# Cognito Inn

*'Inn Cognito'*

Located in the western district of Cloudrend, the Cognito Inn is a bustling hub for adventurers, mercenaries, and agents working on behalf of the Eternal Accord. Known for its warm hearth, strong ale, and lively atmosphere, it serves as both a meeting place and information center. Private rooms and discreet corners cater to those handling sensitive missions, while bulletin boards display requests, bounties, and leads.
