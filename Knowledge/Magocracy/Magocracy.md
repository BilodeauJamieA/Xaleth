# Magocracy

The Magocracy is a nation where arcane power dictates every aspect of life, ruled by the Council of Seven. Their society is strictly tiered, with status determined by magical ability and service to the arcane arts. At the base stand the Sapphires, minor spellcasters who pride themselves on their talents yet are barely distinguished from common folk. Above them are the Emeralds, the thriving class of magical artisans—enchanters, alchemists, and scholars who fuel the nation’s economy with their craft. The Rubies form the lower nobility, wielding political influence and arcane might to maintain order. At the pinnacle sit the Diamonds, the elite noble houses whose bloodlines and magical dominance shape the very destiny of The Magocracy.

The nation holds a particular reverence for Necromancy and Evocation, considering them the purest expressions of magical supremacy. Though feared by outsiders as cold and ruthless, The Magocracy views itself as the rightful inheritor of civilization’s future, with magic as both its foundation and its weapon.
