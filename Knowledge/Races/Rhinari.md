# Rhinari

Rhinari are a sturdy and proud people, their thick hides and horned crowns a testament to their lineage of endurance and might. Broad of frame and steady of spirit, they are renowned for their resilience, patience, and unwavering honesty. Rhinari often serve as stalwart defenders, fearless laborers, or tireless wanderers who bear the weight of hardship without complaint. Their culture values strength, but not only of body—fortitude of will, loyalty to kin, and endurance through trial are equally honored among their kind.

Youngling Rhinari, yet to grow into their full horned majesty, are expected to leave the safety of their herds and embark on the Trial of the Horn. This rite of passage varies among clans, some send their youth to hunt dangerous beasts, others demand a long pilgrimage, and a few task them with acts of courage in foreign lands. Whatever the trial, the younglings are not considered full Rhinari until they return, horns bloodied or hides scarred, bearing proof of their strength and the wisdom earned through struggle.
