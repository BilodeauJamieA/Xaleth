Divinity is a theocratic nation where faith is the cornerstone of governance, and every law, custom, and decision is guided by devotion to the divine. At its heart stands the Supreme Archbishop, who rules as both spiritual and temporal leader, advised by a council of high holy officials. Unlike other nations, Divinity’s society does not scorn those without spiritual power; all are seen as children of the divine, though status is shaped by one’s service to the faith.

The people are organized into four ranks. At the base are the Coppers, the common folk who live their lives under the blessings of the church. Above them rise the Silvers, humble clerics, healers, and diviners who serve their communities directly. The Golds oversee temples, organized churches, and regional faiths, acting as both administrators and spiritual guides. At the pinnacle are the Platinums, the exalted leaders of the land, whose wisdom and authority shape the path of the nation.

The church exalts Abjuration and Divination as the holiest forms of magic, believing they embody protection, truth, and divine will. This stance places Divinity in direct conflict with The Magocracy, whose reverence for Necromancy and Evocation is seen by the faithful as dangerous and profane. To its citizens, Divinity is not just a nation but a sacred mission—an earthly reflection of divine order.
