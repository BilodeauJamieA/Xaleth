# Eternal Accord

The Eternal Accord is a neutral organization with branches spread across every major kingdom, serving as a bridge between those in need and those willing to face danger for coin or cause. Patrons bring requests ranging from simple errands to perilous monster hunts, and the guild organizes these into jobs that adventurers can accept. While anyone can join, advancement within the guild depends on both strength and reliabilityâ€”only those who prove their skill and trustworthiness gain access to the most lucrative or dangerous contracts. Neither tied to crown nor church, the guild thrives on its reputation for fairness, discretion, and efficiency, making it one of the few institutions respected across borders. To many, it represents freedom and opportunity; to others, it is a lifeline of protection in a world fraught with peril.
