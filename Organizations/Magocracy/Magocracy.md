# Magocracy

The Magocracy is a nation where arcane power dictates every aspect of life, ruled by the Council of Seven. Their society is strictly tiered, with status determined by magical ability and service to the arcane arts. At the base stand the Sapphires, minor spellcasters who pride themselves on their talents yet are barely distinguished from common folk. Above them are the Emeralds, the thriving class of magical artisans—enchanters, alchemists, and scholars who fuel the nation’s economy with their craft. The Rubies form the lower nobility, wielding political influence and arcane might to maintain order. At the pinnacle sit the Diamonds, the elite noble houses whose bloodlines and magical dominance shape the very destiny of The Magocracy.

The nation holds a particular reverence for Necromancy and Evocation, considering them the purest expressions of magical supremacy. Though feared by outsiders as cold and ruthless, The Magocracy views itself as the rightful inheritor of civilization’s future, with magic as both its foundation and its weapon.

# Cities

**Cloudrend** 

A breathtaking city of vertical tiers, each a floating disk of earth and rock hovering mysteriously above the landscape. This is the only City within the Magocracy borders, smaller towns and settlements exist but pale in comparison.

**Ground Layer**: A bustling hub of markets, guilds, and common residences. Rising above are three floating layers, each smaller than the one below, giving the city a tapered, spire-like silhouette.

**First Layer**: The largest airborne disk, home to administrative buildings, academies, artisan districts, and open plazas.

**Second Layer**: More compact and prestigious, hosting noble residences, magical laboratories, and high-ranking offices.

**Third Layer**: The smallest and highest tier, reserved for ruling officials, the elite, and sacred temples.

**Sylvan** - Highest Ranks speak it as a way to show superiority as well as speak about things they don't want lower levels to understand

**Elvish** - Closest to Sylvan that the middle levels can learn due to ease of learning and how often it's used

**Common** - Mostly used on lower levels and for interacting with outsiders/external affairs
