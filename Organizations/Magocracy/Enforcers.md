# General Information

A legion of Constructs that is a manifestation of the Magocracy’s will, a constant reminder that the city’s order is not maintained by steel or flesh, but by spell and law intertwined.

The exact process is unknown to the lower ranks but it is generally known that the bodies are forged seperately and then assumed they are powered by a ritual where enchantment, artifice, and necromancy blend to bring them to life. 

Each construct is bound to the Parox Orthian, a living nexus of runes and laws inscribed into the city’s foundation. This ensures that every action they take is not a soldier’s choice but a direct enforcement of codified magical decree. The Parox Orthian resides in the top level of the city where the Council of Seven oversee it.

# Appearance

The constructs take on tall, humanoid forms—faceless statues of crystalline arcana and reinforced metal, their surfaces etched with runes that glow in colors matching the city’s ley-lines.

Their “eyes” are shifting glyphs that pulse whenever they detect unlawful intent, giving the unsettling impression that they can read minds.

Some are clad in plates resembling ceremonial armor, while others float partially disembodied, their limbs connected by strands of raw spell-energy.

# Hierarchy

**Wardens**: The common enforcers, deployed in the streets to quell disturbances, disperse unlawful gatherings, or restrain advent who break sanctioned protocols.

**Judicators**: Larger, more ornate constructs that declare guilt or innocence with prejeduce if resistance is met. Their judgments are magically binding, impossible to appeal without a High Magister’s intervention.

**Sentinels**: Towering, near-colossal constructs stationed at gates, plazas, and archives. Their presence alone is deterrence—each one capable of unleashing city-wide wards should rebellion spark.  They rarely activate but when they do they are considered  devestating and unrelenting.

# Behavior

They are able to speak in all known languages to convey intent and expectations during situations.

When confronting offenders, initially they will verbally confront those involved and in most cases request the immediate surrender.  They subdue with binding spells, suppression fields, or anti-magic shackles rather than brute force—though they are terrifyingly strong when pressed.

Their loyalty is absolute, not to rulers but to the Parox Orthian, ensuring that even the Magocracy must be careful when altering statutes, for the constructs will immediately begin enforcing any change.

# Symbolism

To the Magocracy, they are proof of perfected order, a declaration that chaos and rebellion cannot thrive within walls defended by unyielding, eternal guardians.

To the people, they are an ever-watchful presence—protectors, yes, but also reminders that freedom bends to the written word of spell-law.
