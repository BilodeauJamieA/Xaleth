Uncommon Magic Item - Plate Of Knight's Fellowship

3d4 x 25 gold (additional)

## Current Events

The first few weeks passed in lonely silence, until one night you were 'ambushed' (challenged as clan rites dictate) by a clansman. With nothing left to lose, you fought fiercely and won. Sending the challenger away as duels were never to the death; honor forbade it.

More challengers followed, and soon you learned Malgrum was sending Riders to wear you down, hoping the wilds would finish what they couldn’t. At first, you welcomed the fights as good practice and a way to vent your rage. Eventually, as they grew easier, they became nothing more than an annoyance, delaying your search for the Beast Lord.

After a year in exile, you found your way to the Magocracy, far from your clan’s reach. There, you joined the Eternal Accord, offering your labor in exchange for knowledge that might lead you to a Beast Lord. Their information, however, is guarded by rank, and rank must be earned. So you take on every task offered, no matter how small, determined to climb their ranks and uncover the truths you seek.

Your latest assignment is to investigate a disappearance in a nearby town. Hardly thrilling, and this time you’ll have to work with a team. Still, there’s something that makes it worth your while: completing this task will earn you a long-awaited rank up. One step closer to the knowledge you seek and to your ultimate goal.

## Malgrum 

**Title**: Captain of the Ironhoof Riders

**Race**: (Adult) Rhinari

**Age**: 42

### Description

He has sent multiple from under his command to seek you out and fight you. He bears a deep hatred for Grondar, whom he deems a disgrace to the clan for wielding magic. In Malgrum’s eyes, bringing Grondar down isn’t vengeance, it’s justice.

## Tharok 

**Title**: Chieftain of the Ironhoof Clan

**Race**: (Elder) Rhinari

**Age**: 111

**Class**: Druid (Circle of the Beast Lords)

### Description

Tharok is an elder Rhinari, his once broad frame now weathered and marked with age. For the past few decades, he has led the Ironhoof Clan, his years of experience, devotion, and wisdom earning him the favor of the Beast Lords. His ash-gray hide is streaked with ceremonial scars and painted sigils honoring the gods. Draped in ritualistic robes layered with modest armor and talismans, Tharok carries the presence of a leader chosen by divine will rather than might.

## Ironhoof Clan

**Credo**: “Strength is truth. Honor is life.”

### Boarwardens:

Devoted breeders who cultivate war boars to peak perfection for the Riders. Their work relies on skill and dedication rather than sheer strength, and is honored as sacred labor in the name of the Beast Lords. For this reason, they are among the few in the clan respected rather than mocked for lacking raw power.

For generations, your family has been Boarwardens.  The only exception besides yourself, as far as you are aware, was your Grandfather whom your family rarely spoke of and passed before you were born.

## Beast Lords

### Tharkun - The Supreme Beast Lord

*“Strength tempered by honor rules all.”*

**Symbol**: A towering rhino horn etched in stone

The colossal rhinoceros spirit embodies the ideals of the clan: raw strength, unyielding perseverance, and sacred honor. The Ironhoof believe they are descended from Tharkun himself, and that their innate power and resilience flow from his primal essence. All warriors trace their might and courage back to him, and his judgment guides the clan in matters of strength and honor.

### Korash

*“Together, we are unbroken.”*

**Symbol**: A coiled boar tusk

A mighty boar spirit, Korash is always at Tharkun’s side, representing loyalty, endurance, and the sacred bond between Rider and war boar. His presence explains why the Riders’ connection with their mounts is so intimate and revered—the strength of the Rider and boar together is a reflection of Korash’s spirit.

### Braknar the Stoneback

*“Nurture the beast, and it will carry you to glory.”*

**Symbol**: A jagged turtle shell etched with various marks

An ancient tortoise spirit who watches over boarwardens, guiding the care, raising, and perfection of each generation of mounts. He embodies patience, endurance, and the slow, steady cultivation of strength, ensuring that every boar grows powerful, loyal, and battle-ready. His presence cements the sacred bond between Rider and mount, reminding the breeders that the might of the clan flows through the beasts they nurture.
