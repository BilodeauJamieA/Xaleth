Is your last name family name as leaders of clan, or do all clan members inherit it?


Ashen Expanse miasma has been altering the occupents, after multiple generations some have been given innate magical abilities even if they wouldn't normally.


The first few weeks passed in lonely silence, until one night you were 'ambushed' (challenged as clan rites dictate) by a clansman. With nothing left to lose, you fought fiercely and won. Sending the challenger away as duels were never to the death; honor forbade it.

More challengers followed, and soon you learned Malgrum was sending Riders to wear you down, hoping the wilds would finish what they couldn’t. At first, you welcomed the fights as good practice and a way to vent your rage. Eventually, as they grew easier, they became nothing more than an annoyance, delaying your search for the Beast Lord.

After a year in exile, you found your way to the Magocracy, far from your clan’s reach. There, you joined the Eternal Accord, offering your labor in exchange for knowledge that might lead you to a Beast Lord. Their information, however, is guarded by rank, and rank must be earned. So you take on every task offered, no matter how small, determined to climb their ranks and uncover the truths you seek.

Your latest assignment is to investigate a disappearance in a nearby town. Hardly thrilling, and this time you’ll have to work with a team. Still, there’s something that makes it worth your while: completing this task will earn you a long-awaited rank up. One step closer to the knowledge you seek and to your ultimate goal.
