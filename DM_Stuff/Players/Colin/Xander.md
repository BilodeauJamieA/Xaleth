# Backstory

Xander was born into a family of particularly skilled mages. His father in particular was extremely skilled in teleportation magics. Originally from the Feywild plane, Xander 's father, Porticulus, one day discovered that his expertise in teleportation magic went beyond just basic transportation. He discovered he was able to plane jump. This caught the attention of the wrong people however, and he was caught and forced to use his magic for the Fey Syndicates benefit. While a captor and in their service, Porticulus fell in love with one of his captors, Zyla, and they were soon expecting a child. Not wanting the child to be born into servitude, the Zyla created an opening for her and Porticulus to escape and they plane jumped. They found themselves in the FeyWild of your world, however plane jumping while pregnant had complications. After Xander was born, she would be forever barren and never conceive again.

Porticulus's magical abilities were renowned even on this new plane of existence however, and he settled on the border of the Fey Wilds and the Magocracy. He found that his planar magic worked better near the thinner borders within the Fey Wilds. 

His skills earned himself the title of Emerald, using his planar magic to pull magical items from different planes of existence. Xandar grew up studying this planes magic, wanting to be a great mage like his father and succeed him as an emerald within the Magocracy some day.

However the Fey Syndicate may not have possessed the ability to fully jump between planes, they did possess the ability to communicate across from them. They had promised a Ruby family great wonders to bring down Porticulus and his family. For Xanders 18th birthday, they had gifted him a cursed Glaive, thinking that the unwieldy weapon would prevent Xander from being able to succeed his father properly. The weapon cannot be away from Xander for more than 45 minutes at a time.
Though the Ruby family that cursed Xander has been dealt with, the curse still remains. Porticulus gifted Xander a magical necklace and coordinated for him to be part of the Eternal Accord in order to prove himself and find a way to break the curse.

That was 15 years ago. Xander has learned to use the weapon with his magic and has been adventuring with the Accord ever since, searching for a way to make his father proud. The necklace protects him from being found by the Fey Syndicate easily.
