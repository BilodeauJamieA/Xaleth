Mr.BeauBeau (Mr Bow Bow - Goes by Beau)

Mr.BeauBeau was crafted by Tyezin nearly twenty years ago, shortly after the death of his wife, Elenya. Built as a toy but brought to life, Mr.BeauBeau was gifted to young Claire to ease her grief and provide companionship. 

In time, Tyezin revealed to him that his power stemmed from a shard within his body, a sliver of power from what is known as the Parox Orthian.  Tyezin felt he owed him an explanation but warned him against revealing this unless absolutely necessary. 

# Letter from Claire

Mr.BeauBeau,

By the time you read this, I’ll be gone. I’ve decided it’s time to step out of my father’s shadow and prove myself on my own. My first step is investigating the disappearance of a pair of missing twins in the north slums. I don’t know where it will lead, but it feels like the right beginning.

I hope our paths cross again someday, but for now, I need to walk this road alone. Take care of yourself until then.

Your Forever Friend Claire

**Tyezin**

High Elf Artificer (Savant even among Artificers)
~500 (concealed, rarely mentioned)
Sapphire (ex-Emerald) Rank

He was a part of a group the brought a sentient group of constructs to life.  Originally beginning as a simple collections of toys and over time evolving to what is now known as the Enforcers.

Formerly held the Emerald Rank within the magocracy, though was demoted for reasons unknown and lives more humbly as a Sapphire on the lowest level of the Magocracy.

Appearance: Slim and tall, with silver hair streaked faintly green. His clothing is practical yet eccentric, often adorned with small trinkets, gears, or miniature toys that move on their own. His eyes carry the brilliance of invention, though shadowed by unspoken regret.

Legacy: Remembered as both visionary and exile. Tyezin’s name endures through the sentient constructs known as the Enforcers that trace their origin back to his genius.

**Claire.**

High Elf Artificer
25

Personality: Charismatic, curious, and independent. She has a strong need to prove herself as an adult (especially to Tyezin), but her care for others drives her actions more than pride. She tends to throw herself headfirst into challenges, trusting her wit and her inventions to carry her through.

Appearance: Bright-eyed with a ready smile, she dresses in practical leathers reinforced with bits of brass, glass, and gadgetry of her own design. Often carries a bandolier of small inventions—some reliable, some less so. Her auburn hair is usually tied back, though strands often escape in the chaos of her tinkering.

Legacy (So Far): Though young, Claire has already begun building a reputation as a daring artificer-in-training. She left a note for her child hood toy/friend that she will journey to uncover the fate of a set of missing twins marking her first step into the larger world.

**Elenya**
Human Scholar
42 (age at passing)

Appearance: Remembered as graceful, with dark hair tied in simple braids and gentle eyes that carried both intellect and kindness.

She served as Tyezin’s assistant for many years, their partnership slowly deepening into affection until love naturally took root. In time, they married and soon celebrated the arrival of their daughter, Claire. A few years after her birth, Elenya began to show signs of a lingering illness from which she would never recover. Despite her weakening health, she remained at Tyezin’s side, continuing her work and offering her support with unwavering warmth, always with a smile, even to the very end.
