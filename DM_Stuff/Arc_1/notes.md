# A Vision On The First Night

The dream unfolds in hues too vivid to be real—trees bending in rhythm, light dripping like molten glass through the canopy. You stand unseen among the shifting ferns as a gray Rhinari bursts through the glade, his war boar rumbling behind him. From the mists steps a towering figure of dark metal, its surface glinting like a mirror to the dreamlight.

They fight—each strike echoing like thunder in water—until the Rhinari falls to one knee, breath heavy, but alive. The two speak, their words distant and warped, like whispers through deep water. Then, the Rhinari smiles faintly, and as they clasp hands, the dream ripples outward, dissolving into silver mist before you can hear what was said.

## What you make out from the conversation

“You’ve always misunderstood strength. It isn’t strength of arm or heart that grants true power.”

“ob’s yssynqy robhon unys suam. bhy sily rie euaw spowobs tovb eua bhyows, eua qin myiwn bu bicy ob vwul ubhyws.”

“Your strength is great, but it could be greater. Let me show you.”
