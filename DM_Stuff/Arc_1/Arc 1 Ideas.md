Magocracy has had crime plummet with the Enforcers having been around for the last decade or so.
    - Enforcers are created with the Souls of others
    - Parox Orthian 'mind controls' the souls bound to the constructs
    - Most souls are coming from the 'criminals' but as crime lessened they started using the poor/homeless/etc...
    - Some souls being provided through House Thalirien via Verdant Veil

The Endless Fog is actually the fabric between realms/planes but it's effected by the thoughts and will of whoever enters it.  This is why people don't return, and in most cases end up in bad places because they are thinking about bad places when they enter it

Ashen Expanse miasma is the remnants of an ancient beings death.  The miasma is the leftover 'mystical' energy left from their corpse.  It tends to effect magic in unexpected ways because of it's primordeal essence
