# Dealing With Bandits

## Setup

After navigating winding tunnels and bricked-off passages, the adventurers enter a larger, roughly hewn chamber. The air here is warmer and carries the tang of smoke and unwashed bodies. Wooden supports and makeshift barricades hint that this place is lived in, a hidden base carved into the stone.

## Perception

**Caged captives**: A couple is tied up inside a reinforced cage against the far wall, their faces pale but alert, whispering reassurances to each other.

**Supplies**: Stacks of stolen goods—barrels, crates, and bags—line the walls. Evidence suggests these captives aren’t the only ones who have passed through.

**Bandits**: Shadows flicker along the side of the tunnels; you hear hushed voices and the occasional clatter of metal.

**Tripwires or makeshift alarms**: String and bells have been set to alert the bandits if intruders enter.

## Combat

**The Bandits**:

4 figures are present in the chamber, busy checking supplies, eating, or practicing. Their weapons are crude but functional—short swords, daggers, and crossbows.

**Leader**: A slightly tougher bandit or veteran who coordinates the group and may negotiate or fight if surprised.

**3× Bandit (CR 1), 1× Bandit Captain (CR 3) (2,600 XP)**
