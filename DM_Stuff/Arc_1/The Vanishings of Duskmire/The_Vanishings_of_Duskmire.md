# The Vanishings of Duskmire

## Quest Giver

Town Official (Elder Harwen, Clerk of Duskmire): A weary, pragmatic man tasked with organizing the town’s defense and appeals for aid. He briefs the adventurers on the situation and provides access to local records, villagers, and any resources the town can spare.

Town Official’s Account:
“At first, it didn’t raise much concern. A few adventurers went missing after poking about in the catacombs. Happens now and again—folk assumed they moved on, or lost their way underground. We only suspected otherwise when some of their packs and supplies turned up abandoned down there. Strange, but not unheard of.

Then, it started happening to our own. A handful of long-time villagers simply… disappeared. No signs of struggle, no broken doors, no overturned furniture. Their homes were left tidy, as if they’d just stepped out and never returned.

What truly set us on edge was the most recent case. Another home found in the same state—but this time, a child was left behind. Barely a few months old, hidden away in a compartment. Everyone knew the parents; they would never have abandoned their little one.

We’re not a strong village. Our Town Watch is small—mostly volunteers with pitchforks, not soldiers. So, we sent a formal request for aid to the Eternal Accord. We need outside hands. We need your hands. Find out what’s happening in Duskmire, before more of us vanish without a trace.”

## Possible Tasks

### Investigating the Catacombs Near Duskmire

Clues: faint footprints, discarded personal items, or crude barricades showing recent activity heading in and out.

### Investigating the Homes of Missing Residents

Clues: Some of the homes were locked when they were investigated. All effected homes are connected to catacombs. Barely tracable changes to 'sealed' parts of catacombs in homes.

### Track the Bandits’ Trail

The catacombs stretch ahead like a twisting, stone labyrinth, the air cool and damp, carrying the faint scent of mildew and earth. The tunnels themselves are uneven—walls slick with moisture, floors littered with broken stones, and sections collapsed long ago, forcing careful climbing or narrow squeezes.

**Footprints** dusted with fine ash or mud lead into bricked-off passages, then vanish at dead ends or reappear further along.

**Discarded items**—rusted tools, scraps of cloth, or overturned crates—hint that small groups have been moving supplies through these hidden corridors.

**Scuff marks and scratches** line the walls, some deep enough to suggest hurried passage, others almost deliberate, like markers to guide those who know the way.

**Faint odors** of cooking fires, smoke, or even livestock linger in some alcoves, revealing the tunnels aren’t entirely abandoned.

Every turn seems to echo with the faint shuffle of movement, and shadows twist unnaturally in the corners. Even as the deeper chambers grow quieter and colder, the signs are unmistakable: someone—or something—has been using these blocked-off passages, and the labyrinth is far from empty.
