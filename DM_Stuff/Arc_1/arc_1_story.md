Getting Players Together

    - Giri gets hired by Eternal Accord to investigate
    - Xander already works for Eternal Accord and investigation is something he is told to head
    - Beau gets pulled in 

Investigation
    - Not the twins
    - Outside of Cloudrend to the northwest
        village called Duskmire
    - A few villagers and persons passing through
        unsure if getting lost in the catacombs
    
    First was just adventurers, assumed they just moved on or got lost down in the catacombs.  Only reason they knew/suspected was some left behind supplies / bags but nothing crazy.

    Then a few of the more permanent residents seemed to be in the same situation.  Homes were mostly clean and organzied, no sign of struggles.

    Most recently what brought it to the front of local investigations was another home found in almost the same way, except a few month old child was found in a hidden compartment. Those that new the couple knew they would never leave their child behind

    Sent out assitance request to Eternal Accord since the village doesn't have much of it's own local militia barely having a few on Town Watch (mostly volunteer)
