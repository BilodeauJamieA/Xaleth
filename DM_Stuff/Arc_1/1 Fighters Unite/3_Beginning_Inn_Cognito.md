# Beginning Inn Cognito 

As you step through the oak doors of the Cognito Inn, the hum of conversation and the scent of spiced ale wash over you. The western district’s finest gathering place for adventurers, mercenaries, and Accord agents is alive with energy—maps spread across tables, coins clinking, and laughter rolling like thunder.

In one corner, a bard strums a lute, weaving tales of daring heroes and clever rogues, her voice rising above the din just enough to draw a few wistful smiles. Tankards lift in time with her rhythm, the whole room swaying to the song of adventure.

The ever-watchful barmaid, moves with practiced grace. Dodging elbows, pouring drinks, and offering sharp words or a warmer smile as the moment demands. She seems to know every face in the room.

## Barmaid Mira

Mira greets each person warmly, announces the day’s special, and points them toward where they need to go. She’s seems used to dealing with Eternal Accord agents, while also still handling regular patrons.  She has a table setup for the Duskmire team.

If they ask she will reveal a little bit of what she knows about Duskmire
    
    Rumor: “You don’t want to be wandering those catacombs, trust me. I’ve heard plenty have disappeared over the past few years. Ghostly voices, dragging the curious away… they say even the bravest adventurers end up leaving nothing but their armor behind.”

## The Cunning Star of Cloudrend

A tiny, sprightly Halfling perched on a stool, golden-brown curls bouncing with every movement and wide hazel eyes shining with mischief. She strums her enchanted lute, which shimmers with each note, filling the room with music and laughter. Her colorful patchwork clothes glitter with trinkets and charms, and a jingling belt pouch around her waist.

You hear patrons cheer and clap as she works, often refering to her as "Twinklestrings"

"Listen up, good folk, and lean in close! ’Twas in the twisting alleys of Cloudrend’s slums that this poor bard—yours truly—found herself in a rather… compromising position. A gang of thugs thought to have a laugh at my expense. Foolish, wasn’t it?"

"But then—like moonlight catching a jewel—she appeared! Radiant and clever, with eyes that sparkled like mischief itself. No sword in hand, mind you! Just magical tools, blinking and buzzing, and in moments, those ruffians were tumbling over each other, trapped in their own confusion."

"And me? I was safe, not a hair harmed! I tried to thank her—oh, I did!—but she vanished as quickly as she came, leaving only a shimmer of magic and a smile that promised the city had yet to see the last of her."
