## Road To Duskmire

**Day One**

Gentle hills, scattered groves, and winding streams; birds and small wildlife dart across the road.

Road is moderately maintained, but doesn't seem to show signs of regular use.

Mist spreads as night falls and the party sets up near a small grove of thin trees.

### Korrin vs Malgrum

That night Giri recieves a vision during his meditation

**Day Two**

Mist turns to fog, eventually the village appears in the distance as they crest a particularly large hill, smoke rising from chimneys.

Duskmire looms ahead, quiet streets with no signs of the townspeople.
