# 'Construct'ed Encounter

## Setup

The party will be attacked at night during camp when they get within a day or two of Raven's Hallow.

## Perception Check

**DC 10**
You hear a deep, rumbling thud in the distance, followed by the faint tremor of the ground beneath you. Something heavy is approaching the camp.

**DC 15**
The sound grows louder—each impact like a boulder dropped on packed earth. You catch glimpses of a large silhouette between the trees, lumbering closer with unnatural steadiness.

**DC 20**
The air grows thick with dust and residual magic.

---

A large Rhinari appears, runes etched across its arms and chest with blank dull orange eyes. Bits of soil and pebbles tumble from its limbs as it exhales a grinding, earthen sound.

## Perception Check

**DC 10**
A flicker of iridescent light flits at the treeline. Something hovers, wings beating, soot-streaked and grinning. Her gauntlet glows as she guides the Rhinari from a safe distance, eyes gleaming with dark delight as she watches the chaos unfold.

## Post Combat

**Small Black Onyx** (50 gp)

Green Aura - Sliver of Parox Orthian

### Arcana or History Check

**Beau**

DC 10 - *PASS*: You feel the connection to the energy in the sliver, it is the same feel as the magic that holds your own form together. *FAIL*: Faint green energy feels familiar but without time to study you are currently unsure. 

**Xander**

DC 15 - *PASS*: This sliver seems to be strikingly similar to what is uncommonly known to power the Enforcers. *FAIL*: This seems closer to the accounts you’re familiar with of puppeteering a being, rather than true necrotic undeath.

**Grondar** & **Giri** only able to percieve shiny rock

**Maul of Terror** *requires attunement* (12,000 gp)

## Combat

**Rhinari Flesh Golem (CR 5)(2,700)**
**Pixie Wonderbringer (CR 5)(2,700)**
