# Into The Woods

**Ciphered Dream** (A week after first dream) As the party travels Giri recieves a second dream, this time it warns of the soul manipulation in use.

**Sigil Remembrance** - Beau, after sleeping has a deeper understanding of the Verdant Veil symbol

You wake in the dim quiet of your room, your mind is still elsewhere, tangled in fragments of what you remembered in your sleep. Not dreams, exactly… more like echoes of voices.

You remember overhearing whispers - faint, half-formed, as if carried through walls or memory itself. A symbol was mentioned, something important, its meaning tied to your master. You can almost recall the tone cautious and fearful, words about his exile, about something he’d done or discovered. But the details blur the moment you reach for them.

All that lingers is that symbol, the sense that it mattered, and a chill certainty that whatever truth it holds has been buried. You know it connects to your master’s fall. You just can’t remember how.

## Turtle Dove

A turtle-dove appears.  It is an emmisary of Braknar seeking the aid of Grondar to put a stop to Malgrum.

## 'Construct'ed Encounter

Lirael sends Rokhan in to fight the party during a late night stop.  

Rokhan only has 1 charge on *Maul of Terror*

Lirael stays at a distance and will attempt to flee if Rokhan is defeated or if she believes she is in danger. 

Lirael will mention Korrin's name as she flees

## Unwelcome

Townsfolk eyeball Grondar.  Some weary, some tense, some run.

Guards speak of not wanting any trouble.
