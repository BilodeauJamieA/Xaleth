# Ciphered Dream

Bway Tuggyssâ€™s voice drifts like a distant wind, calm yet impossibly vast:

## Message

"The flow of souls stirs uneasily. Shadows linger where light should guide, and echoes of the departed wander, lost between worlds."

"An imbalance has taken root, and the threads of life and death fray where they once wove together seamlessly."

"Heed this disturbance, for the harmony of all that lives depends on their release, and those who ignore it may find themselves adrift alongside the trapped and forgotten."
