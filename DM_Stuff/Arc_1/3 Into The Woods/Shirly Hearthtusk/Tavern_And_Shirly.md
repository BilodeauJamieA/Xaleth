# Tavern And Shirly

The Tavern and Shirly is a warm, inviting inn on the edge of Raven’s Hollow’s main square. Its wooden sign swings gently above the door, carved with a winking face and the words “Tavern and Shirly”. Candlelight spills through the windows, painting the streets with a soft, golden glow, promising warmth and respite even in the town’s tense atmosphere.

Freshly brewed ale, cider, and spirits, often with a local twist.

Hearty meals like roasted root vegetables, stews, and fresh-baked bread.

**Give a Story, Get a Story**: Shirly offers advice, news, or discreet information—sometimes in exchange for a favor or a story.
