## Description

Shirly, a female Loxodon, runs the inn with gentle authority. Her gray, leathery hide is dusted with flour and herbs from the kitchen, and her large ears twitch attentively at every sound. Her tusks are polished and engraved with subtle floral patterns, a personal touch of artistry. She moves with surprising grace for her size, offering kind smiles and wise counsel to those she trusts. Her deep, rumbling voice carries a comforting warmth, whether sheâ€™s serving drinks or sharing local news.
