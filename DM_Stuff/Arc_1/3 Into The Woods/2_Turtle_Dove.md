## Setup

Just after dawn, the forest is bathed in soft, golden light, and a dove perches on a low branch beside the path. Its gray-and-white feathers catch the morning glow, and the tiny shell on its back gleams faintly. It sits utterly still, eyes bright and alert, giving the uncanny sense that it has been watching the party’s approach all along—patient, quiet, and strangely expectant.

## Nature Check

**DC 15**

The turtle dove is a rare animal not native to these parts, and its calm, watchful presence is said to be a gentle good omen for those who encounter it.

## Marked Words

"I come on behalf of Braknar."

"He has chosen you, Grondar, to confront Malgrum."

"Malgrum has strayed from the path of honor, and it falls to you to set matters right."

"This is no task for the faint of heart; tread carefully and let wisdom guide your hand."

"Complete this charge, and Braknar will grant you his mark—a token of power, favor, and the weight of his trust."

"Know that destiny watches closely, and every choice you make echoes far beyond the path before you."

### Lesser Mark of Braknar

Upon accepting the task, Grondar will recieve a lesser mark of Braknar.  It will appear in a place of his choosing and feel like his body warms, centering on the location before abruptly ending as mark appears.
