# Unwelcome

## Setup

As the party crests the last hill before Raven’s Hollow, the dense forest opens to reveal the town’s timbered streets. Smoke curls from chimneys, and the distant clatter of a sawmill reaches their ears. Guards meet your eyes and approuch.

**Guards**: Polite but stiff, offering cursory greetings: “State your business.”

**Townsfolk** whispers - observant characters may notice hushed conversations, fingers pointing discreetly, or glances toward a specific party member.

## Insight or Perception Check

DC 10: Notices the subtle tension and whispered glances; the villagers’ unease is not personal but connected to someone resembling a party member.

DC 15: A few townsfold seemed to be having hushed conversations, fingers pointing discreetly, or glances toward a specific grondar.
