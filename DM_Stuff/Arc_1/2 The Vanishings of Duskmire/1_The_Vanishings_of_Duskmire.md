# The Vanishings of Duskmire

## Quest Giver

Elder Harwen (Town Official): A weary, pragmatic man tasked with organizing the town’s defense and appeals for aid. He briefs the adventurers on the situation and provides access to local records, villagers, and any resources the town can spare.

Town Official’s Account:
“At first, it didn’t raise much concern. A few adventurers went missing after poking about in the catacombs. Happens now and again—folk assumed they moved on, or lost their way underground. We only suspected otherwise when some of their packs and supplies turned up abandoned down there. Strange, but not unheard of.

Then, it started happening to our own. A handful of long-time villagers simply… disappeared. No signs of struggle, no broken doors, no overturned furniture. Their homes were left tidy, as if they’d just stepped out and never returned.

What truly set us on edge was the most recent case. Another home found in the same state—but this time, a child was left behind. Barely a few months old, hidden away in a compartment. Everyone knew the parents; they would never have abandoned their little one.

We’re not a strong village. Our Town Watch is small—mostly volunteers with pitchforks, not soldiers. So, we sent a formal request for aid to the Eternal Accord. We need outside hands. We need your hands. Find out what’s happening in Duskmire, before more of us vanish without a trace.”


## Investigating the Catacombs Near Duskmire

Clues: faint footprints, discarded personal items, or crude barricades showing recent activity heading in and out.

## Investigating the Homes of Missing Residents

Clues: Some of the homes were locked when they were investigated. All effected homes are connected to catacombs. Barely tracable changes to 'sealed' parts of catacombs in homes.

## Underground Connector

### Investigation Check

**DC 5**
A pile of broken glass near a splintered crate, not much dust (looks recent)

**DC 10**
A boot track, partially swept away near the crate

## Track the Bandits

The catacombs stretch ahead like a twisting, stone labyrinth, the air cool and damp, carrying the faint scent of mildew and earth. The tunnels themselves are uneven—walls slick with moisture, floors littered with broken stones, and sections collapsed long ago, forcing careful climbing or narrow squeezes.

### Perception Check

**DC 10**
A mark on the wall on one of the sides of a fork in the path (left)

**DC 20**
The faintest trace of what smells like a cooking fire briefly wafts through the air

## Caged Couple

Tibbin Bramblefoot (M): Slight and wiry, with sandy hair that curls at the ends, freckled cheeks, and large, anxious brown eyes. Wears tattered travel clothes, now dirty from confinement.

Lyria Bramblefoot (F): Petite and delicate, with chestnut hair tied loosely behind her head, wide green eyes that dart constantly, and a faint build reflecting her young age.

<!-- Child Rowan was hidden in a cupboard -->

**Captivity**:
The couple had been caged for roughly two weeks within the bandit camp. Though not long enough to cause severe physical deterioration, the confinement left them pale, exhausted, and tense, their spirits clearly shaken.

**Behavior After Rescue**:
Even once freed, both appear almost dazed and disengaged from their surroundings. Their only focus is their child (Rowan), repeatedly asking after the baby’s safety. They barely respond to questions, and little else seems to matter to them, their worry and exhaustion entirely consuming their attention.
