# The Slime Ambush

## Setup
The party rounds a bend in a narrow, damp tunnel. The floor is slick with moisture, and the faint drip of water echoes from somewhere deeper. Ahead, the tunnel splits around a low, jagged pile of rocks, forming a natural bottleneck.

## Perception Check

**DC 5**
Smell a tangy, acidic odor invades your senses

**DC 10**
The stone floor glistens oddly in the light, almost like oil with the rainbow of colors, but with a strong greenish tint.

**DC 15**
On closer inspection, small patches of what looked like oil residue clings to the walls and rocks, leaving behind irregular globs and streaks.

### Nature Check

Anyone above 15 for previous check makes a Nature Check:

**DC 15**

Your instincts allow you to recall monsters known as ooze that live in places that fit this description.  You know they can range from slight nusances to outright menaces.

**DC 20**

This appears to be a Gray Ooze den.  They blend in with natural bodies of water until prey approuches, and they rarely hunt solitary.  Player is allowed to see ![Gray Ooze](./Gray_Ooze.png)
