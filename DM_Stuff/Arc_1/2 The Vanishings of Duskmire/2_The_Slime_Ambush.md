# The Slime Ambush

## Setup
The party rounds a bend in a narrow, damp tunnel. The floor is slick with moisture, and the faint drip of water echoes from somewhere deeper. Ahead, the tunnel splits around a low, jagged pile of rocks, forming a natural bottleneck.

## Perception

**Unusual sheen**: The stone floor glistens oddly in the torchlight, almost like oil, but with a faintly greenish tint.

**Soft squelches**: Every few steps, the adventurers hear faint, wet squishing sounds underfoot—not consistent with their own movement.

**Sticky residue**: On closer inspection, small patches of gelatinous residue cling to the walls and rocks, leaving behind irregular streaks.

**Faint smell**: A tangy, acidic odor hints at something living nearby.

## Combat
