## Orb of Acid - Lvl 4

**Conjuration** [Acid]

**Casting Time**: 1 standard action

**Range**: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Saving Throw**: Fortitude partial

An orb of acid about 3 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 4d6 points of acid damage. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target.

A creature struck by the orb takes damage and becomes sickened by the acidâ€™s noxious fumes for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect but does not reduce the damage.

**Sickened**: The effected creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
