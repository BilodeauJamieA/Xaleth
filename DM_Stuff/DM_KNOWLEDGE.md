# Thalirien

**Alliance with the Verdant Veil**: Seeking greater power and status, the Thalirien secretly allied with a fey syndicate to locate Emerald Porticulus and his family. The syndicate’s planar knowledge and network of spies allowed the Thalirien to extend their reach beyond the city’s borders, tracking transplanar signatures and magical movements.
