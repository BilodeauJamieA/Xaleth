## Description

He stands over seven feet tall, a warforged of dark steel and reinforced alloy. Smooth, angular lines define his humanoid form, with faintly glowing runes tracing across his chest and limbs. 

His featureless head bears only a pair of shifting glyphs in place of eyes, radiating a cold, calculated awareness. Every movement is precise and deliberate, joints whirring softly, conveying both relentless efficiency and formidable strength.
