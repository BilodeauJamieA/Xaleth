# Description

A quiet, introspective Harengon woman whose tall, slender frame and soft grey-brown fur make her seem almost ethereal. Her long ears twitch subtly with every emotion, and her pale amber eyes often reflect the weight of unspoken sorrow: she has lost the ability to have children, a loss that has left her cautious and reserved.

Despite her quiet nature, Lyra is deeply compassionate and profoundly skilled, her portals reflecting both her inner strength and her vulnerabilities. She is a figure of subtle grace and restrained power, someone whose mastery over space comes at the cost of constant self-awareness.

Her ability to open portals is intimately tied to her emotional state. Joy, calm, and focus allow her portals to open cleanly and reliably, while sadness, anger, or grief can make them unstable, misaligned, or even dangerous. She has learned to carefully regulate her feelings, though her heart often betrays her, and those close to her can feel the tension between her delicate control and the storm beneath.
