# Tharok 

**Title**: Chieftain of the Ironhoof Clan

**Race**: (Adult) Rhinari

**Age**: 111

**Class**: Druid (Circle of the Beast Lords)

## Description

Tharok is an elder Rhinari, his once broad frame now weathered and marked with age. For the past few decades, he has led the Ironhoof Clan, his years of experience, devotion, and wisdom earning him the favor of the Beast Lords. His ash-gray hide is streaked with ceremonial scars and painted sigils honoring the gods. Draped in ritualistic robes layered with modest armor and talismans, Tharok carries the presence of a leader chosen by divine will rather than might.
