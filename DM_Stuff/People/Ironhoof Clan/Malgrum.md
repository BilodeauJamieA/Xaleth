## Description

A towering Rhinari warrior and captain of the Riders, an elite band of war-boar cavalry. Proud and battle-hardened, Malgrum sees himself as the true embodiment of Rhinari strength. He bears a deep hatred for Grondar, whom he deems a disgrace to the clan for wielding magic. In Malgrum’s eyes, bringing Grondar down isn’t vengeance, it’s justice.

A towering figure of gray hide and quiet gravity — the color of weathered stone and old storms. Deep creases etch his thick skin where years of battle and sun have hardened it, and faint scars cross his shoulders like pale lightning across slate. His horn, once sharp and proud, bears a chipped edge — not from neglect, but from use.
