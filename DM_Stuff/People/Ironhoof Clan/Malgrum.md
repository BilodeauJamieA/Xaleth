## Description

A towering Rhinari warrior and captain of the Riders, an elite band of war-boar cavalry. Proud and battle-hardened, Malgrum sees himself as the true embodiment of Rhinari strength. He bears a deep hatred for Grondar, whom he deems a disgrace to the clan for wielding magic. In Malgrum’s eyes, bringing Grondar down isn’t vengeance, it’s justice.
