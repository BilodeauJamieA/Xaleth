## Description

Daughter of Tyezin Rien

Bright-eyed with a ready smile, she dresses in practical leathers reinforced with bits of brass, glass, and gadgetry of her own design. Often carries a bandolier of small inventionsâ€”some reliable, some less so. Her auburn hair is usually tied back, though strands often escape in the chaos of her tinkering.
