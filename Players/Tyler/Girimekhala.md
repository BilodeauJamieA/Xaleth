# Girimekhala – Backstory 

You may call me Giri, but I am known to some as Girimekhala. My true birth name is buried in memory, forgotten even to me. I was born among the faithful of Divinity, raised in their order, taught their rites and prayers. For years I believed I belonged.

When I came of age, the nightmares began. In dreams I spoke with another tongue, harsh and forbidden, Infernal, the language of demons. Eventually the clergy found out, and what they did not understand, they feared. They seized me and with fire they branded the symbol for Girimekhala into my skin, a demon of corruption from ancient times. The scars became my curse, my exile, my shame. My herd wept but turned away, bound by the church’s decree.

I wandered the world, carrying the weight of that name and the whispers that clawed inside my mind. They urged me to pride, to anger, to violence. I nearly gave in, until I stumbled into the Fae Wilds. There, among ancient trees and living spirits, I found something greater than fear, I found balance. A spirit of silver light came to me, not to banish the darkness, but to teach me to walk with it.

Light and shadow are not enemies, it showed me, but two halves of the same whole. The whispers remain, but they no longer own me. I walk a narrow path, demon touched, spirit guided, a Taoist wanderer. Each step is a choice. Each breath is balance.
