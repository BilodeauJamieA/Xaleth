# Hallowhide Herd

The Hallowhide herd is a devout community within Divinity, composed largely of monks, clerics, paladins, and other servants of faith. United by discipline and devotion, they wander the kingdom offering wisdom, spiritual guidance, and martial training rooted in sacred philosophy. Their way of life blends prayer, meditation, and combat practice, teaching others how to balance body, spirit, and devotion. In Divinity, they are both respected mentors and humble pilgrims, sustaining themselves by sharing their teachings with all who seek enlightenment.

## Master Calveth the Stillhand
Loxodon Monk

Appearance: Wrinkled gray hide, adorned with simple prayer beads and worn robes. His tusks are smooth with age, etched faintly with devotional carvings.

He was a mentor to you in your youth.  Though his calm appearance is almost completely indiscernible, you are sure he was upset by your exile.

## Sister Merial 'Dawnveil'
Loxodon Cleric

Appearance: Strong but youthful features; her tusks are decorated with soft ribbons of cloth given as tokens by those she has healed. Her silver robes glimmer faintly at sunrise.

One of your closest friends growing up, but as the years progressed you grew apart.  It seemed her duties becoming the next spiritual leader of the herd always took precedence.  She did not appear on the day you were exiled.

# Fae Wilds

**Bway Tuggyss**

The fateful day that swayed your spirit in to alignment was when you had a short but profound meeting in the Fae Wilds with a spirit that only introduced themselves as Bway.

Bway Tuggyss appeared as a andromorphic, ethereal being floating gracefully. Their form radiated with otherworldly energy, their face obscured and hidden behind a glowing veil of silver light.

What you remember from your meeting:

"Qhomg uv ringywonb shigur, gu nub bwyldmy. O il bhy Bway Tuggyss, ing O hify rimcyg sonqy dyvuwy bhy girn uv boly."

*She tilts her head seeing your confusion then speaks again but this time in common*

"Forgive me, little oneâ€¦ it has been long since I last shaped words in your tongue." 

"The night has not claimed you, though it clings to your heart. Lift your gaze, my light is yours, and no darkness may bind you while I stand beside you. Rest, and let the weight of your grief fall into my hands."

"In moments of need, in hours of doubt, speak my name within your heart, and I shall hear. You are never beyond my reach, so long as you remember my name."

*A small glass orb appears on the ground below where she was floating as she fades away. You can sense a similar aura as her radiating from the orb. (This is the Driftglob)*
