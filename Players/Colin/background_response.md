## 'Emerald' Porticulus (Father)

A late-60s Harengon, Emerald-ranked in the Magocracy, husband to Zyla and father of Xander. Tall, silver-furred, and jade-eyed, he masters transplanar manipulation, shifting objects and beings across dimensions. Pragmatic yet mischievous, he is clever and unpredictable, maintaining his rank through a deal with the Magocracy to supply them with rare items while living independently.

## Zyla (Mother)

A quiet, introspective Harengon in her early 60s, wife of Emerald Porticulus and mother of Xander. Skilled in transplanar portal creation, her ability is tied to her emotions: calm and joy yield stable portals, while grief or anger can make them dangerous. Ethereal and reserved, she carries the weight of losing the ability to have children, balancing profound compassion with restrained, precise magical power.

## Korrin Veilstrider

You haven't met him, but during the original events with the Thalirien family you learned he was the one they made the deal with.

You learn from your father he is known as the  Enforcer and Collector of the Verdant Veil, and one of the four known leaders

**Race**: Warforged

**Role**: Enforces the syndicate’s will and retrieves high-value captives or goods.

**Personality**: Silent and terrifyingly efficient, Korrin rarely speaks, communicating mostly through actions. His presence alone terrifies those who know his reputation.

## House Thalirien

You were suprised with a gift on your 18th birthday when a package arrived for you from this family.  The gift was an exceptionally crafted glaive and a summons to their estate.  The summons was to talk business and spoke of your potential, knowing how well your father was doing.

Arriving at the estate it quickly became apparent that it was a trap as they attempted to capture you in an attempt to get your father and mother to surrender quietly.  Through sheer force of will and cleverness you were able to escape that night but not completely unscathed and more specifically an effect was activated on the glaive you were gifted as you attuned to it.

Since that day you have been unable to be away from the glave for more than around half an hour, with your longest known time being almost 45 minutes.  The longer you are away the more you feel the draw to it and the headaches begin.

You don't know specific persons of the house currently, last you heard there was a shift in power within the family after that night.

**Rank & Reputation**: The Thalirien are a minor noble Elven family within the Magocracy, holding modest influence but known for their sharp minds and ambitious nature. They operate a specialty merchant business, trading in arcane components and rare enchanted reagents—goods essential to spellcasters and magical artisans throughout the city.

**Alliance with the Verdant Veil**: Seeking greater power and status, the Thalirien secretly allied with a fey syndicate to locate Emerald Porticulus and his family. The syndicate’s planar knowledge and network of spies allowed the Thalirien to extend their reach beyond the city’s borders, tracking transplanar signatures and magical movements.
