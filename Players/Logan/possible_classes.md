# Warmage Class (House of Pawns) 
Neat Cantrip focused
 
# Path of  the Colossus Barb
Super neat - Size Increase / Blocking stuff (3/4 cover -> full)

# Toon Magic Sorcerer
Love random and could be fun, but would probably require a decent amount of RP to cover 'realism' and maybe a slight adjustment to backstory

# Oath of the Sun Paladin
Meh? Not aweful, but not seeing relation to background
 
# Shadow Master Rogue
Maybe, but still unsure how it would relate to current background
 
# School of Somnomancy Wizard
Its already hard to seperate ingame from metagame some times and 'sleep walking' seems like it could be really rough to RP naturally
