# **Background**



My Creator, **Tyezin**,  a genius artificer who was once a part of the **Emerald Tier** of the **Magocracy** was later forced out to the slums of the **Sapphire Tier** due to his Obsession with trying to give a toy life after his wife died during the birth to their daughter, **Claire.** He researched the magic and designs of what powers the various Constructs of the City, putting that knowledge and a small device he created, his goal was finally achieved. Upon my awakening I was given two tasks, to be friend and guardian to Claire. Being a friend was easy, however to achieve being a guardian would take studying and time so my creator would get me various magic tomes and scrolls to read and learn from.

Many years had passed, spending my days with Claire and my nights studying, Tyezin was able to make a business out of manufacturing and selling living toy constructs to any and all alike. While things seemed to be doing great within our small family, there stirred some small talkings of people going missing within Sapphire Tier, and Claire whose stubbornness, much like her father's, grew to want to investigate into this problem more and more, leading her to leave a note for me to find one morning, telling me that, she is an adult now and doesn't need to be protected anymore, and that she is leaving to find the cause of these rumors and to live my life, to finally go out and see the world outside of the Magocracy, and that we will see each other again if fate permits.
