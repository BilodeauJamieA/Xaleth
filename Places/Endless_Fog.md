The Endless Fog is a vast shroud that stretches along every horizon, a pale-gray veil that encircles the known world. It drifts and churns like a living mist, swallowing light and sound in its depths. Countless expeditions—by land, sea, and sky—have vanished within, never to return, leaving only fear and speculation in their wake. Some believe it marks the very boundary of creation, while others claim it hides lost continents, divine realms, or horrors too great to name. Whether it truly encompasses the entire world or conceals paths beyond is unknown. What is certain is that the Fog lingers, eternal and unbroken, a haunting reminder of mysteries that lie just beyond mortal reach.
